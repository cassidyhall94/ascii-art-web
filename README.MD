    Usage: In a browser type the following: localhost:8080 to see the webpage after entering (go run .) in the terminal.
    You can then enter the text in the text box that you would like to be converted to ascii art.
    Secondly, you select the font or banner style that the art will be in.
    Thirdly, you click the Generate Art button to be taken to a new webpage with the ascii art displayed.
    Implementation details: There is a function which converts text to ascii art. We use this in another function for the server, and print the converted text as art on the webpage.
